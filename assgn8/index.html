          <p>HIIT is a type of workout that involves brief bursts of intense effort broken up by a short rest or active recovery.<p></br>
          <p>A HIIT workout does mean that you're doing a cardio workout that includes short bursts of hard work, but the key is that during those bursts you're exerting yourself at almost max effort.</p>

                <h4 class="dz-benefits-title">Efficient</h4>
                <p>HIIT is the ideal workout for a busy schedule - whether you want to squeeze in a workout during your lunch break or to get
                  in shape for a fast-approaching event. Research shows you can achieve more progress in a mere 15 minutes of interval training
                  (done three times a week) than the girl jogging on the treadmill for an hour.</p>

                <h4 class="dz-benefits-title">Burn more fat</h4>
                <p>Not only do you burn more calories during a HIIT workout, but the effect of all that intense exertion kicks your body's repair
                  cycle into hyperdrive. That means you burn more fat and calories in the 24 hours after a HIIT workout than you do after, say, a
                  steady-pace run.</p>

                <h4 class="dz-benefits-title">Build a healthier heart</h4>
                <p>Most people aren't used to pushing into the anaerobic zone (that lovely place where you can't breathe and you feel like your
                  heart is trying to jump out of your chest). But in this case, extreme training produces extreme results. One 2006 study found
                  that after 8 weeks of doing HIIT workouts, subjects could bicycle twice as long as they could before the study, while maintaining
                  the same pace.</p>

                <h4 class="dz-benefits-title">No equipment needed</h4>
                <p>Running, biking, jump roping, and rowing all work great for HIIT, but you don't need any equipment to get it done. High knees,
                  fast feet, or anything plyometric like jumping lunges work just as well to get your heart rate up fast. In fact, some equipment
                  like dumbbells can make HIIT less effective because you want the focus to be on pushing your heart to its max, not your
                  biceps.</p>

                <h4 class="dz-benefits-title">Lose weight, not muscle</h4>
                <p>Anyone who has been on a diet knows that it's hard to not lose muscle mass along with fat. While steady state cardio seems to
                  encourage muscle loss, studies show that both weight training and HIIT workouts allow dieters to preserve their hard-earned
                  muscles while ensuring most of the weight lost comes from fat stores. Win/win!</p>

                <h4 class="dz-benefits-title">Increase your metabolism</h4>
                <p>In addition to increased fat burning and more muscle preserved, HIIT stimulates production of your human growth hormone (HGH) by
                  up to 450% during the 24 hours after you finish your workout. This is great news since HGH is not only responsible for increased
                  caloric burn but also slows down the aging process, making you younger both inside and out!</p>

                <p>You can do it in a boat, you can do it with a goat. You can do it here or there, you can do it anywhere! Dr. Seuss would have
                  loved HIIT. Since it's such a simple concept - go at maximum effort for a short period of time followed by a recovery period and
                  repeat. You can adapt it to whatever time and space constraints you have.</p>

                <h4 class="dz-benefits-title">Challenge yourself</h4>
                <p>This is not a workout you can do while reading a magazine or chatting with your friend. Because it's so short, you will be working
                  hard the whole time. The trade-off is this format offers seasoned exercisers a new challenge and new exercisers a quick way to see
                  results. You may be in pain, you may be sucking wind, but you definitely won't be bored!</p>
